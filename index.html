         <img src="images/pic.jpg" alt="self-picture" height="500" width="500">
        <p>I am a driven and dedicated college student pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In addition to my studies, I also work at Amazon Fulfillment Center, where I have developed skills in problem solving and teamwork. My experience in both academics and the workforce has allowed me to build a strong foundation in technology and teamwork.</p>

<p>My background in computer science has provided me with a strong understanding of programming languages, data structures, and algorithms. I have also had the opportunity to apply these skills in various projects and assignments, showcasing my ability to turn theoretical concepts into practical solutions. At Amazon, I have honed my ability to work effectively in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, as well as my skills in communication and collaboration.</p>

<p>In the future, I hope to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the tech industry. I aspire to work for a company that values innovation and creativity, and that provides opportunities for personal and professional growth. Ultimately, I hope to use my expertise to help advance technology and make a difference in people's lives.</p>
